trio_4bar_lokl_small_q1    MusicVAE 	       A 4-bar, 'trio' model for melody, bass, and drums, with a 4-step conductor level. Trained with a strong prior (low KL divergence), which is better for sampling. Less accurate, but smaller in size than full model. Quantized to 1-byte weights.	17.6	
trio_16bar_xl 		   MusicVAE 	       A 16-bar, 'trio' model for melody, bass, and drums, with a 4-step conductor level. This is a very large model that should be good for both accurate reconstruction and good sampling. Because of its size, we recommend only using this checkpoint locally (i.e. on a Node server), and not on the client size.	1710 (1.71 GB)
